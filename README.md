> **Many tools, one command.**

A unified CLI that aggregates many small standalone tools into a single discoverable, version-tracked interface. Instead of remembering where dozens of scripts live or hunting through folders, just use `dz <tool> [args]`.

## Why DazzleCMD?

Have you ever accumulated a collection of small utilities and handy scripts over the years -- spread across multiple folders, computers, some on network drives, some local, most not on GitHub -- and found yourself constantly forgetting where things live or what they're called?

Or maybe you've written a quick Python script to solve a problem, used it a few times, then couldn't find it six months later when you needed it again? Or you have tools that are useful but too small to justify their own GitHub repo, but also too valuable to leave scattered and unversioned?

Enter `dz`...

DazzleCMD provides a single entry point for all your tools. Each tool keeps its own structure and versioning. Dazzlecmd simply provides the discovery and dispatch layer. Tools that grow complex enough can "graduate" to their own repos (which can in turn be nested internal to "dz" as git submodules). Tools that stay small stay organized, easy to find, and simple to track.

## Features

- **Unified Dispatch**: Run any tool with `dz <tool> [args]` -- argparse-based with per-tool subparsers
- **Kit System**: Curated tool collections -- `core` ships with dazzlecmd, `dazzletools` bundles the default collection
- **Polyglot Support**: Python, shell, batch, compiled binaries -- dispatch handles runtime differences transparently
- **Progressive Scaffolding**: `dz new my-tool` starts minimal (blank canvas), `--simple` adds TODO/NOTES, `--full` adds roadmap and tests
- **Namespace Organization**: Tools grouped under `projects/<namespace>/<tool>/` to prevent collisions at scale
- **Platform-Aware**: Each tool declares both a quick-glance platform category and specific verified OS list
- **No Modification Required**: Existing scripts work as-is -- dazzlecmd wraps them, doesn't rewrite them

## Installation

```bash
pip install dazzlecmd
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DazzleTools/dazzlecmd.git
cd dazzlecmd
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```bash
# List all available tools
dz list

# Run a tool (all arguments pass through)
dz dos2unix myfile.txt
dz rn "(.*)\.bak" "\1.txt" *.bak
dz delete-nul C:\projects
dz links -r --type symlink,junction    # Find all symlinks and junctions recursively
dz links --broken                      # Find broken links in current directory

# Get detailed info about a tool
dz info dos2unix

# List kits and their contents
dz kit list
dz kit list core
dz kit list dazzletools

# Create a new tool project
dz new my-tool                  # Bare minimum: manifest + script
dz new my-tool --simple         # + TODO.md, NOTES.md
dz new my-tool --full           # + ROADMAP.md, tests/, private/

# Version info
dz --version
```

## Included Tools

### Core Kit
These are the tools that ship with dazzlecmd. They are available everywhere and always active.

| Tool | Description | Platform |
|------|-------------|----------|
| [`find`](docs/tools/core/find.md) | Cross-platform file search powered by fd | Cross-platform |
| [`fixpath`](docs/tools/core/fixpath.md) | Fix mangled paths, search for files, open/copy/browse | Cross-platform |
| [`links`](docs/tools/core/links.md) | Detect and display filesystem links (symlinks, junctions, hardlinks, shortcuts) | Cross-platform |
| [`listall`](docs/tools/core/listall.md) | Flexible directory structure listing with sorting and collection | Cross-platform |
| [`rn`](docs/tools/core/rn.md) | Rename files using regular expressions | Cross-platform |

### DazzleTools Kit
The default [DazzleTools](https://github.com/DazzleTools) collection.

| Tool | Description | Platform |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `claude-cleanup` | Stage and commit Claude Code transient state files | Cross-platform |
| `dos2unix` | Pure-Python line ending converter (dos2unix/unix2dos) | Cross-platform |
| `delete-nul` | Delete Windows NUL device files created by accidental `>nul` redirection | Windows |
| `srch-path` | Search the system PATH for executables | Cross-platform |
| `split` | Split text by separator with optional token filtering | Cross-platform |

## How It Works

1. **Discovery**: On startup, `dz` scans `projects/<namespace>/<tool>/` for `.dazzlecmd.json` manifests
2. **Kit Filtering**: Only tools belonging to active kits are loaded
3. **Parser Assembly**: Each discovered tool gets an argparse subparser
4. **Dispatch**: When you run `dz <tool> [args]`, the runtime type determines how the tool executes:
   - `python` with `pass_through: false` → imports the module and calls the entry point directly
   - `python` with `pass_through: true` → runs via subprocess (for tools with non-standard signatures)
   - `shell` / `script` / `binary` → subprocess with appropriate interpreter

## Tool Manifests

Each tool has a `.dazzlecmd.json` manifest:

```json
{
    "name": "dos2unix",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "description": "Pure-Python line ending converter",
    "namespace": "dazzletools",
    "language": "python",
    "platform": "cross-platform",
    "platforms": ["windows", "linux", "macos"],
    "runtime": {
        "type": "python",
        "entry_point": "main",
        "script_path": "dos2unix.py"
    },
    "taxonomy": {
        "category": "file-tools",
        "tags": ["text", "line-endings", "conversion"]
    }
}
```
